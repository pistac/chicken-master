Device compatibility
You will need a keyboard to complete the HIT. Please use a computer or laptop. You may also use a tablet connected to an external keyboard.

# Second page (long instructions)

In this task we are going to recreate a scenario that you might have lived many times in real life. Imagine that you are walking, and suddenly you realise that someone is walking on your same path, but towards you. If one of you doesn't swerve, you will crash into each other. What do you do?

Here, you will see different robots walking towards you. You can press the SPACE key if and when you want to swerve.

Please press the SPACE key now to familiarize yourself with the movement.

The robots that you will see will sometimes be controlled by other Mechanical Turk workers, who are doing the task at the same time as you; other times the robot will be controlled by an AI (artificial intelligence). At the start of each round, a text will tell you who is controlling the robot that you are about to see. Just please bear in mind that it might take a few seconds longer to connect to another worker.

In the next page, you will be able to customise your own appearance in the task (your avatar).
